## Description

I added this cool project called [flamethrower](https://github.com/fireship-io/flamethrower) to my product site, hopefully it doesn't have any silly bugs

## Distribution

please include `bot.js` in the attachment directory as a separate download from the local docker setup download (`Dockerfile` + `src`) if possible :)
